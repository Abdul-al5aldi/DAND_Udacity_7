# Project 7: Communicate Data Findings
### Data Analyst Nanodegree - Udacity
### Analyzing Ford GoBike System Data


## Dataset

The data consist of information regarding approximately 1.86M bike rides from fiscal year 2018. Including the trip start/end time, start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user type, gender, and birth year. The data was cleaned by dropping rows with outliers in the member age, like those who are older than 100 year. The data can be found [here](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data) along with its feature documentation.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found many intersting information about the behavior of the two types of users for the system: subscribers who are generally daily commuters go on short trips towork. Subscribers usually rent a bike on weekdays at (8 AM - 9 AM) and (5 PM - 6 PM). The other type is customers, they are usually tourists or occassional riders who ride a bike on weekends to explore the bay area. There was a high demand around summer session at (May - Oct), and a significant drop  at (Jan - Mar), most likely because of the bad weather conditions at that time of the year. Lastly, I explored the genders. Generally, males have the highest number of trips that is approx. 3 times females trips. Also, females spend slightly longer time in their trips compared to others. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the influence of time, day, month. I started by introducing the bikes monthly usage, usage time for each user type, followed by bike rides per gender. After introducing each finding, I showed the plot that suggested that findings. I've made sure to use approprite color palettes that will make the visualizations look clean, clear and attractive.
